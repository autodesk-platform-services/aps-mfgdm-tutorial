# About this tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase the new **MFG Data Model API**. It’s OK if you are not familiar with the overall Autodesk Platform Services APIs as the Data Models are bringing a new approach to accessing granular data. But to be familiar with other aspects, especially when you are ready to code the MFG Data Model into your web app, please make sure you are familiar with APS. If you are new to the platform, you can start at the [APS Tutorials page](https://tutorials.autodesk.io).

The MFG Data Model is a new approach for getting granular data. If you are already familiar with Model Derivative data from a Fusion file, this data will look very familiar to you. The Data Model approach to accessing data brings a “real-time” aspect to the data, and also direct access to the data you need. Model Derivative is basically a file conversion, and as a result, all the data is produced at once, putting the burden of accessing it granularly on you – the developer. The MFG Data Model, instead, will allow you to access specific types of data directly, bringing the promise of granular data to life. Model Derivative data is a “snapshot” of data at a given time or version, while MFG Data Model once initially published, will stay synchronized by the Fusion design changes, and also includes design versioning.

In this tutorial, we'll go through a set of queries you can make using the new **MFG Data Model API** v2 (currently in public beta).
We'll walk you through the prerequisites, initial workflows, advanced queries, and some interesting cases that can be covered using this API.

If you're interested in any of the following cases, then this tutorial is suitable to you:

1. Get hub and project contents
2. Access Fusion model properties (part number, description, etc)
3. Retrieve physical properties (bounding box of design, mass, volume, etc)
4. Export to other files formats (STEP, OBJ, STL)
5. Manage your hubs and projects
6. Use custom properties
